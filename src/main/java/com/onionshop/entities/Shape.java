    /**
     * The Shape class is an abstract class where individual shapes extends from.
     * The actual design and implementation of the Shape class and its interaction with its child classes will be
     * explained below:
     *
     * === Expectation of the function of the Shape tool on canvas ===
     * 1. User clicks on canvas, creates a dot which acts as the starting point of any shape
     * 2. User clicks again on any point on the canvas again, the shape is drawn in between the start point and this
     *    point â€“ the end point.
     *
     * === How it's implemented ===
     * startingCoordinate       the first coordinates which the user clicked on
     * endingCoordinate         the second coordinates which the user clicked on
     * drawStage                a variable that keeps track of which stage of the shape tool drawing process is
     *                          currently active
     *
     * === drawStage and each stages' purpose ===
     * When drawStage = 0
     *      This is the initial stage prior to the user drawing anything on the canvas
     *
     * When drawStage = 1
     *      This is the stage where the user have drawn the first dot, the canvas should display the starting point
     *      accordingly
     *
     * When drawStage = 2
     *      This is the stage where the user have clicked on the canvas a second time, the canvas should display the
     *      actual shape by calculation
