# Progress Report

## What has worked well so far with our design:
- Memento pattern worked well in the undo-redo implementation as it made possible the copying and storing of the current canvas plus the roll back of various states, 
- Flexibility of Tool structure allows for multiple branchings of tools such as the brushes and the shapes, or other possible tools in the future. 
- The template method has worked incredibly well with the brush and shape tools as they both involve a certain amount of standardization with the possibility of having multiple child classes. 
- The structure using the drawStage makes it simple to execute the shape drawing and possible future modifications. 
- The new drag feature implemented for shape tool instead of the point-click feature adhered better to program accessibility as it is significantly less confusing to draw a shape now
