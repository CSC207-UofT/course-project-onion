## Accessibility Report

1) Equitable Use:
   - Our Onionshop program is open source and free to use for everyone with access to github. 
   - To adhere to the principle, we could allow user customization of the UI in the future so that users can interact with the program in a way that is easiest for them.

2) Flexibility in Use:
   - Having large buttons of tools and a large space for color palette ensures that the user can be accurate and precise as using the software. 
   - To adhere to the principle, one feature we could implement is to allow the user to customize the layout of buttons so they can set up the interface at their own preference.

3) Simple and Intuitive Use:
   - The open recent project and create new project user interface are very simple and of high contrast in color. The shapes and tools buttons on the toolbar are intuitive to use and the color palette is labelled with instructions to help users better understand how to use it. 
   - Exceptions when creating projects, saving and loading projects are caught and thrown to provide users feedback of what went wrong. 
   - Since the exceptions are done in the java console, one thing we could add in the future is pop up windows with error messages to present the message to the user more clearly.
            
4) Perceptible information
   - The UI colors are high contrast and the font is appropriate so that it’s easier to read and navigate even for people with visual impairment. We also have imagery representations of tools and shapes on the toolbar. 
   - One thing we could add is a high contrast theme option in the drawing UI to maximize legibility of information for everyone. 

5) Tolerance for Error 
   - We provided warnings for hazards and errors by throwing exceptions to let the user know what is going on and what to do to prevent the error from happening. 
   - The undo feature is a fail-safe feature we implemented to bring back something that is accidentally deleted and should not have been. The user can also redo an action that is undone, which makes the program more error-tolerant.
               
6) Low Physical Effort
   - There is a most recent projects user interface that allows users to access recently closed projects with minimal effort rather than digging around in the path where it is saved. 
   - The drawing is automatically saved so that the user doesn’t have to worry about losing progress or hitting a save button every time he/she draws a few strokes. 

7) Appropriate Size and Space 
   - We didn’t consider how people with different physical or mobility characteristics are able to use our program since this principle doesn’t really apply to drawing softwares. For people of different hand grip sizes or in seated or standing positions, the design of the program doesn’t affect how they can approach it.

We would market our program to casual art enjoyers and those who are interested in starting to create artworks. Onionshop doesn’t have as many tools like fill, crop and text tools and functionalities like transforming layers and exporting compared to professional drawing softwares, for example Adobe Photoshop and Krita. But it is lighter in size and has a more visually appealing user interface for beginners while having enough functionalities to still be usable as one advances his drawing skills. Fewer options and tools allows the user to focus more on the artwork instead of worrying which brush or tool to choose. Due to the simplified and more beginner-friendly process of drawing , it is more likely for people to open up the program and enjoy doing some simple arts.


The program is less likely to be used by people who have no intention of doing arts and artists who are already deeper into the field that they rely on the more complex functionalities of professional software to create their artwork. People who are not interested in arts wouldn’t bother to even download our drawing program. Professional artists would use, for example, the layers feature and undo-redo feature much more frequently, which are still glitchy in our program. It is also very common for artists to use a drawing pad, which our program does not support very well. Artists who create arts on iPad would also be less likely to use Onionshop because it is open source and is not on AppStore.
